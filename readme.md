## TODO

- Store the service descriptions in the table rows with the name and prices. Maybe even loop through the database query results to display the blocks on the services page!
- Finish up the Contact page - embed a map to the salon, and add a contact form that emails the owner.
- Create a login page and a page that allows the salon owner to update the prices.
- Can you think of how you might use a new table to allow clients to request service bookings online?
